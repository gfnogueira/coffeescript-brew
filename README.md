# 🍺 coffeescript-brewdevlog

Welcome to `coffeescript-brewdevlog` — a casual coding bar where I experiment with CoffeeScript and log my learning process. This repo is part of the `*-brewdevlog` series — a playful and focused set of repositories for learning programming languages, one sip at a time.

## 🧬 What is CoffeeScript?

CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It simplifies the syntax and removes boilerplate, making your code cleaner and more expressive.

## 🍻 What's Brewing in This Repo

Inside you'll find small and focused CoffeeScript experiments, such as:

- ✅ Syntax and language basics  
- 🧪 Functional programming and mini projects  
- 🛠️ CLI and browser-side test cases  
- 🔄 Transpilation and comparison with JS  

Each file is an independent micro-batch of learning.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Make sure you have Node.js installed. Then:

```bash
npm install -g coffeescript
```

To run a `.coffee` file:

```bash
coffee filename.coffee
```

To compile it to JavaScript:

```bash
coffee -c filename.coffee
```

## 💭 Philosophy of the Brew

This repo is not production-grade code — it's about:

- 🧠 Learning by brewing code  
- 🧪 Testing flavors of syntax  
- 💡 Having fun with functional discovery

## 📜 License

MIT License — brew, share, and remix freely.

Cheers to learning something new!
