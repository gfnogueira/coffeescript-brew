# ☕️ coffeescript-brew

Welcome to `coffeescript-brew` — a cozy little space where I experiment with CoffeeScript and keep my learning journey brewing. This repository is part of my `*-brew` series, a set of playful and focused repos for exploring different programming languages and tools, one cup at a time.

## 📖 What is CoffeeScript?
CoffeeScript is a little language that compiles into JavaScript. It offers a more elegant syntax with less boilerplate, making it fun to write clean and readable code.
